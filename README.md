This is my updated bedrock formation finder that supports 1.12, 1.13, and 1.14 generated bedrock. Compared to my last version, the search is also highly optimized.

I'm gonna make a video on it soon, so I'd recommend waiting just a little bit if you're interested.

### Build instructions:
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```
